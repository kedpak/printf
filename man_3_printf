.SH NAME
.B _printf.c 
- This program recreates a custom printf function in C. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS #include <stdarg.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include "holberton.h"
    #include <unistd.h>

unsigned int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf produces a data type passed through the format to stdout. _printf returns the number of characters printed based on the amount of argument characters passed through the function. 

.B Format string 
A format string consists of a string of characters. Default characters (characters that are %) are duplicated to the output. The conversion specifiers that are intitilized by the % ends with a conversion specifier. Each of the arguments must  correspond correctly with the conversion specifier (ex. _printf("Hello, I own %d cats and %d dogs", 3, 5)). 

.B Flag characters
The _printf function takes several flag characters that convert it to an alternative form. The characters are followed by the % symbol. The characters used for conversion include c,b,s,i,d,u,o,x,X,%. 

.SSHc - This conversion specifier represents characters.  
      b - This conversion specifier represents binaries.
      s - This conversion specifier represents strings.
      i/d - The i and d specifiers represents integers.
      u - This conversion specifier converts unsigned integers.
      o - This conversion specifier represents octals.
      x - This conversion specifier represents lowercase hexidecimals.
      X - This conversion specifier represents uppercase hexidecimals. 
      % - This conversion specifier represents the % character. 

.SH HELPER FUNCTIONS
Several helper functions are utilized inside of the _printf function. Each format specifer is called by a custom fucntion. 

.SH EXAMPLES
_printf("Hello, we have %d dogs", 3);

output: Hello, we have 3 dogs

-------------

_printf("%s", "Hello, World");

output: Hello, World!

-------------

_printf("I a%c very sl%cepy", 'm', 'e');

output: I am very sleepy


.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value is the length of characters excluding the NULL character. Specifically a signed integer is returned from the _printf function, which represents the amount of characters the helper functions pass. 

.SH OPTIONS
Does not take options at this time.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs as of now.
